# Automatic Files Sorter By Date
It is a personal little project to help me sorting my thousands of photos and videos taken by myself.
Sorts the files inside a folder by date and moves them into new folders with the date as the name's folder. (Group by date).
It's useful helping you sorting photos and videos since it grupos them by last date modification, then you only need to rename each folder.
Ok, you still have left work to do,  but it is better renaming 25 folders than classifying 2000 files, is not it?
